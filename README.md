# Daves Toolbox
## Overview
- This repository is where I am currently keeping all of the different bits and pieces of useful and multipurpose code and design that I'm finding on my web dev journey. It started with utility classes and functions, but now I'm added whole pages elements. We will see what else I can find to add to my collection. Most elements that have HTML, CSS, and JS are included in separate HTML documents to keep information organized. Any more in-depth tutorials that I write will be in their own folder as they contain more material.
